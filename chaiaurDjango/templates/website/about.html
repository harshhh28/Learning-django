        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          At Chai aur Code, our mission is to bring together coding enthusiasts
          over a cup of chai. We believe in fostering a community where learning
          and sharing knowledge is as refreshing as a hot cup of tea.

        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>
          Founded in 2023, Chai aur Code started as a small meetup group for
          developers in DAIICT. Over time, it has grown into a vibrant community
          of coders who come together to share ideas, work on projects, and
          enjoy some chai.
